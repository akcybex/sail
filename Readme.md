# Sail
Sail offers an immersive local development experience powered by Docker, designed for PHP, WordPress, Python, CodeIgniter, and more. It seamlessly works across macOS, Windows (WSL2), and Linux, eliminating the need for additional software or libraries on your local machine. With Sail's user-friendly CLI, you can effortlessly kickstart your application development, even without prior Docker expertise.
